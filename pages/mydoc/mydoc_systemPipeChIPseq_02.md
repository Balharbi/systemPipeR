## Generate workflow environment

Load workflow environment with sample data into your current working
directory. The sample data are described
[here](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/systemPipeR/inst/doc/systemPipeR.html#load-sample-data-and-workflow-templates).


```r
library(systemPipeRdata)
genWorkenvir(workflow = "chipseq")
setwd("chipseq")
```

Alternatively, this can be done from the command-line as follows:


```sh
Rscript -e "systemPipeRdata::genWorkenvir(workflow='chipseq')"
```

In the workflow environments generated by `genWorkenvir` all data inputs are stored in
a `data/` directory and all analysis results will be written to a separate
`results/` directory, while the `systemPipeChIPseq.Rmd` script and the `targets` file are expected to be located in the parent directory. The R session is expected to run from this parent directory. Additional parameter files are stored under `param/`.

To work with real data, users want to organize their own data similarly
and substitute all test data for their own data. To rerun an established
workflow on new data, the initial `targets` file along with the corresponding
FASTQ files are usually the only inputs the user needs to provide.

## Run workflow

Now open the R markdown script `systemPipeChIPseq.Rmd` in your R IDE (_e.g._ vim-r or RStudio) and run the workflow as outlined below. 

### Run R session on computer node

After opening the `Rmd` file of this workflow in Vim and attaching a connected
R session via the `F2` (or other) key, use the following command sequence to run your R
session on a computer node.


```r
q("no")  # closes R session on head node
```


```bash
srun --x11 --partition=short --mem=2gb --cpus-per-task 4 --ntasks 1 --time 2:00:00 --pty bash -l
module load R/3.6.0
R
```

Now check whether your R session is running on a computer node of the cluster and assess your environment.


```r
system("hostname")  # should return name of a compute node starting with i or c 
getwd()  # checks current working directory of R session
dir()  # returns content of current working directory
```

The `systemPipeR` package needs to be loaded to perform the analysis steps shown in
this report (H Backman et al., 2016).

If applicable users can load custom functions not provided by `systemPipeR`. Skip
this step if this is not the case.
